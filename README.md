# slides.css

A CSS framework for creating PDF presentations.

slides.css is a HTML and CSS alternative to traditional slideshow software.

It utilises a browser's "Save to PDF" capabilities and CSS positioning to create
PDF presentations.

This repository contains:

- `slides.*.css`, the CSS framework powering the print styles; and
- `slides.*.js`, an optional JavaScript plugin that provides enhancements to the
  CSS framework, such as improved slide numbering.
